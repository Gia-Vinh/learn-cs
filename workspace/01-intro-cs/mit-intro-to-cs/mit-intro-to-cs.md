# MOTIVATION
## Goal

Moving from electrical engineering, try to give my career a bit more cs foundation.

## Expected positive outcomes

I'll start to have systematic knowledge in my career, enhance my chances of finding new places to work or simply get promoted for current.  

## Expected obstacles and plan to overcome

### Time
as a married adult with full time job, the work life balance is already challenging. So I'll have to cut some of my leisure time for the learning. 

if 1st obstacle comes, i'll have to cut down the allocated time for this course to the point it is still sustainable.

### Morale

demotivated during the course.

if being demotivated, i'll take a break for a few days with actual plan when to come back

# Week 1: Python basics
## Introduction to python

Try to think of a problem in a computational manner.

ENGAGE WITH COMPUTATIONAL MODE OF THINKING

what does a computer do?
    * perfoms calculations really fast
    * remember results
 
TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE

computer knows what you tell them

Declarative knowledge is a statement of fact 
 
    > i.e. There is candy taped to the underside of one chair

Imperative knowledge is a receipe or "how-to"
 
    > i.e. a how to recipe to cook an egg.

=> this is a what we need to focus on in this course

**Computer are machines**. Let's look into how to capture a recipe in mechanical process:

* Fixed program computer. i.e Calculator, [Alan Turing's bombe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe)
* stored program computer. i.e.: machines stores and execute instructions
